# Efficient and Scalable Reinforcement Learning


### Counteractive RL: Rethinking Core Principles for Efficient and Scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning

####  Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight Presentation.

This paper introduces a fundamental paradigm for reinforcement learning that accelarest learning. Our approach centers on solely reconstituting and conceptually shifting the core
principles of learning and as a result increases the information gained from the environment interactions of the policy in a given MDP without adding computational complexity. Our analysis and method provide a theoretical basis for efficient, effective, scalable and accelerated reinforcement learning.
